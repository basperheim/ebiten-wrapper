OK and how can I make a simpler version of that code that just renders the one image in the center of a screen in a loop? Nothing fancy or complicated. I'm just trying to learn the basics of erbiten

Creating a simpler version of the code that just renders one image in the center of the screen using Ebiten is a great way to understand the basics. You'll focus on initializing the game engine, loading an image, and drawing that image in the center of the window. Here's a straightforward example to get you started:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "os"
    "image"
    _ "image/png" // Import to decode PNG images
    "github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2"
)

const (
    screenWidth  = 320
    screenHeight = 240
)

var (
    ebitenImage *ebiten.Image
)

func init() {
    // Open the image file
    file, err := os.Open("assets/myImage.png")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to open image file: %v", err)
    }
    defer file.Close()

    // Decode the image
    img, _, err := image.Decode(file)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to decode image: %v", err)
    }
    ebitenImage = ebiten.NewImageFromImage(img)
}

type Game struct{}

// Update proceeds the game state. Update is called every tick (1/60 [s] by default).
func (g *Game) Update() error {
    // Here you could handle game logic, input, etc.
    return nil
}

// Draw draws the game screen. Draw is called every frame (1/60 [s] by default).
func (g *Game) Draw(screen *ebiten.Image) {
    // Calculate the position to draw the image centered
    w, h := ebitenImage.Size()
    x := (screenWidth - w) / 2
    y := (screenHeight - h) / 2

    // Draw the image at the calculated position
    screen.DrawImage(ebitenImage, &ebiten.DrawImageOptions{
        GeoM: ebiten.GeoM.Translate(float64(x), float64(y)),
    })
}

// Layout takes the outside size (e.g., the window size) and returns the (logical) screen size.
// If you don't have to adjust the screen size with the outside size, just return a fixed size.
func (g *Game) Layout(outsideWidth, outsideHeight int) (int, int) {
    return screenWidth, screenHeight
}

func main() {
    ebiten.SetWindowSize(screenWidth*2, screenHeight*2)
    ebiten.SetWindowTitle("Simple Ebiten Example")
    if err := ebiten.RunGame(&Game{}); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

Key Points of the Simplified Code:
Image Loading: The image is loaded from the file system in the init function. This ensures the image is available before the game starts.
Game Structure: The Game struct implements the ebiten.Game interface. The interface requires you to define Update, Draw, and Layout methods.
Rendering Image: The Draw method calculates the position to center the image on the screen and draws it. The screen's width and height are used to determine the exact center.
Running the Game: The main function sets up the window size and title, then starts the game loop by calling ebiten.RunGame.
This code provides a basic framework for a game/application in Ebiten. You can adjust the window size, title, or image file as needed. The simplicity of the code should help you grasp the essentials of game development with Ebiten.
